I am Keane Moraes. I am a first year university student studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I am extremely interested in cryptography, quantum computing and information security. Recently, I have taken to learning information theory and have delved into Shannon's work. I aspire to do reasearch at the intersection of these fields and I am particularly passionate about studying post-quantum cryptography

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my cryptography and quantum computing repositories.
- ðŸ’» My recent coding adventures are in :
  * Java through Jetbrains Academy Java Developer Track
  * Ethical hacking through TryHackMe's Offensive Pentesting Learning Path
  * Modern Cryptography through Cryptohack and Cryptopals learning modules.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about linear algebra, integral calculus and C in first-year uni. Additionally, I am picking up pentesting skills on TryHackMe's learning path.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on building secure and reliable systems. I wish to learn more about secure deployable APIs
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning information theory and quantum information processing.
