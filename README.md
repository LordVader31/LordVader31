My name is Keane Moraes. I am a 1B university student studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I am extremely interested in cryptography, quantum computing and information security. Recently, I have taken to learning information theory and have delved into Shannon's work. I aspire to do reasearch at the intersection of these fields and I am particularly passionate about studying post-quantum cryptography

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my cryptography and Jetbrains academy repositories.
- ðŸ’» My recent coding adventures are in :
  * Java through Jetbrains Academy Java Developer Track
  * Ethical hacking through TryHackMe's Offensive Pentesting Learning Path
  * Modern Cryptography through Cryptohack and Cryptopals learning modules. 
  * Sharpening my math and science skills through Brilliant.org
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently picking up pentesting skills on TryHackMe's learning path. I will be taking Coursera's Cryptography and Information Theory Specialization for Intermediate Learners by the Uniceristy of Colorado Boulder. I am very excited to study about these fields in more detail.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on building secure and reliable APIs.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning information theory and quantum information processing.
